# Netflix Clone

This project is a small, design-focused app developed as the final project for the Dart/Flutter course at my Faculty of Computer Science. It serves as a simplified Netflix clone, showcasing clean UI design and basic functionality.

The APK is available in the source code for installation and testing, and you can find some code snippets and screenshots of the app below.
